# NYC_GREEN_TAXI_TRIP-ANALYSIS
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the New York City Green Taxi Trip Records dataset. The dataset contains millions of trip-level records collected by the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC).

The purpose of this analysis is to:

Explore trip patterns

Study passenger behavior

Derive revenue-related insights

Uncover trends that can benefit taxi companies, drivers, and policymakers

The analysis covers multiple aspects including distance, fare amounts, tip amounts, pickup and drop-off locations, and time-based demand trends.

Dataset
The dataset includes detailed information about each trip, such as:

Pickup and Drop-off Datetime

Trip Distance (miles)

Passenger Count

Fare Amount

Tip Amount

Total Amount

Payment Type

Data Source: NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission

Objectives
