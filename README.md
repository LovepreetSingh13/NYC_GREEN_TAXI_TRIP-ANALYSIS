# NYC_GREEN_TAXI_TRIP-ANALYSIS
Overview

This project explores and analyzes the New York City Green Taxi Trip Records dataset provided by the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC). The dataset consists of millions of individual trip records, including details such as pickup and drop-off locations, trip distance, fare amount, passenger count, payment type, and tip amount. The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of taxi usage patterns, identify factors that influence revenue, and uncover actionable insights that can assist taxi companies, drivers, and policymakers in decision-making.

Dataset

The dataset contains rich trip-level details, including pickup and drop-off timestamps, location IDs, distance traveled in miles, number of passengers, fares, tips, and total trip amounts, as well as the type of payment used. Together, these attributes provide a comprehensive view of how green taxi services operate in New York City. The data used for this analysis was obtained from the official TLC records, which serve as a reliable source for transportation research and policy evaluation.

Objectives

The main objective of this project is to perform a detailed exploratory data analysis of green taxi trips. Specifically, the analysis aims to identify how distance impacts revenue, which pickup and drop-off zones are the most profitable, how time of day and day of week affect demand, and how different payment methods correlate with tipping behavior. Additionally, the project evaluates passenger count trends and their influence on both trip length and earnings. Through these analyses, the project provides a holistic view of the dynamics underlying green taxi operations.

Analysis and Insights

The analysis reveals several important findings. Revenue generally increases with trip distance, although the revenue earned per mile declines beyond medium-distance trips, suggesting diminishing returns on very long journeys. A small number of zones account for a disproportionately large share of revenue, indicating that certain locations act as key demand hubs. The majority of trips are relatively short, often under three miles, but long-distance trips, while less frequent, contribute significantly to overall earnings. Time-based analysis shows that evenings witness the highest number of trips and the greatest revenue generation, while weekdays and weekends display distinct demand patterns. Payment type analysis highlights that credit card transactions dominate and are strongly associated with higher tip amounts compared to cash, pointing to behavioral differences among passenger groups.rocessed dataset
